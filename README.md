# Swim Infolink

Swim Infolink has been designed to share information that the target audience may find helpful when they are: 
1. searching for a swimming pool, club, or lessons, 
2. looking for recommendations on products they might use when going swimming, or teaching someone to learn to swim, 
3. thinking about what to pack when they go swimming.

The target audience are people who are thinking of going swimming, or taking someone else swimming. It will be useful because it will provide a single location from where visitors can easily access relevant information, including links to water-safety advice and a pool finder, and obtain insights about tried-and-tested swimming-related products that can help someone to improve their swimming or their overall experience of visiting the pool.
